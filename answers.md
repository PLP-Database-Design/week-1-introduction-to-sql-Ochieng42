components of a database management system 
databased user-individual who interacts with the database.
data-raw figures stored and managed within database
hardware-is the actual database software itself with its associated applications and utilities

a relational database is a type of database that organise data into interconnected tables,each consisting of rows and column
examples include :MySQL,PostgreSQL,oracle and microsoft SQL server
claasification of SQL
data defination language-used to define and manage the database structure
data manipulation language-used to manipulate data within tables
data control language-used to manage user access and permissions.

primary key is aunique identifier of each row in a column while a foreign key is column or sets of column in a table references the primary key of another table.
an entity relationshp diagram is a virtual representation of the entities,attributes andrelationships within a database.

adavantages of relational databse 
data intergrity-ensure data accuracy and consistency forced through constraints
data redundancy reduction-normalised data models minimise duplicate data saving data storage space and improve efficiency
data flexibility-data can be easily accessed and manipulated
data security-access control mechanism restricting unauthorised access ,protecting sensitive information
scalability-they can handle large amounts of data and numerous users efficiently.
data types in tables
INT-stores interger values
VARCHAR-stores variable-length strings pf text
DATA-stores date  values
DECIMAL-stores decimal numbers with specified precision and scale

purposes of DBMS
data storage and retrival-provide mechanisms for storing ,retrieving and manipulating data
data security and intergrity-ensures data accuracy and consistency while protecting data from unauthorised access
data concurrency control-manage simultanous access by multiple users,preventing conflicts and inconsistencies.
data backup and recovery-provide mechanism for backing up data and restoring data incase of failures
